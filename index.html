        <h3>Design & Development & Early Life</h3>
        <p class="development">It all began in 2003 at the age of just 5, a small boutique in my village got their internet caf√© and that was unheard in a tiny village,
           I remember I was going to help my grand father to milk the sheep just to get a small tip and go to play at the internet caf√© for as long  as the money would allow me!
            And then I discovered my passion for computers! </p>
        <p class="development">Fast-forward 10 years when I got my very first computer, I will never forget! It was a Dell Inspiron M5030 with potato specs but for a very first computer it was a great machine for me! 
          After no more than 3 years I went from a computer illiterate to a frequent deepweb user :D
           I loved all the security and all the possibility the internet has to offer but Unforciunatly for me 
           I had just meet the biggest barrier that I could meet, that was English language, 
           so I start learning it in 2016, then in December of 2016 I moved to Sweden and then I learned Swedish, currently I am learning Greek also. </p>
        <p class="development">In 2017 I also discovered Swift and, you guested, I start to use it in making all kind of single view application, I started to love the front end, the UI and UX.
           After that I picked C# to make some cross-platform games in unity, so far I have never posted something in the play store or app store but this is a milestone for the near future!</p>
        <p class="development">As of now, I am a Web Developer at <a href="https://www.fourlanos.se/" target="_blank">Fourlanos </a> and <a href="https://www.lex-ferenda.se/" target="_blank">Lex Ferenda</a>
          and a full time student at <a href="https://www.strathmore.edu/" target="_blank">Strathmore University</a> in Kenya studding Computer Science. 
          My programming skills are the following:
